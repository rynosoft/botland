With the release of iOS 11.1, Apple introduced a bug that occurred when using the default keyboard. Specifically, autocorrect would suggest replacing occurrences of "i" with what would initially appear to be an "A" followed by a question mark inside a square. Autocorrect was appending a Variation Selector 16 character which is supposed to cause the previous character to have an emoji appearance. For "i", the selector is invalid so the correct behavior is undefined.
